# Bye-Bye RSA
Shor’s Algorithm famously provides a way to break the standard RSA encryption scheme, which relies on the computational complexity of the prime factorization problem to ensure security. More qubits than have been implemented on a single machine are required for it to be effective against RSA, but with the current rate of advancement in quantum hardware, it is not a matter of if, but when we will have the computational power required.

While RSA is the most popular and ubiquitous encryption scheme threatened by Shor’s Algorithm, other encryption schemes are also at risk. As we get closer to implementing Shor’s Algorithm on a real quantum computer, cryptographers have begun exploring alternative encryption schemes that are secure against it. This article explores one such scheme.

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
Quantum encryption methods leverage the principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement disturbance, to ensure secure communication. In other words, an adversary interfering with a quantum channel will always fundamentally alter the information moving through the channel. The drawback to such a scheme is the required use of quantum channels, which are difficult to establish and expensive to maintain. Typically, quantum channels are established using fiber optics, as such channels produce minimal noise.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can be used to establish a shared secret key between two parties. Now, I must confess that I have lied in the lead-up to this section. Technically, QKD protocols are not encryption schemes themselves, but protocols for establishing a symmetric key. In cryptography, symmetric keys can be used to encrypt information in a perfectly secure way using encryption schemes like the One-Time Pad (OTP). Such an encryption scheme is impossible to crack, whether using a classical or quantum device.

In the past, establishing a symmetric key has only been possible when the key is delivered in person. If one were to send the key via an information channel, it could be intercepted by an adversary. This is obviously impractical — hand delivery of keys is not a viable long-term strategy, especially if the parties are far apart. However, using QKD, it is possible to establish a symmetric key via a quantum communication channel while ensuring perfect security.

The most well-known QKD protocol, and the one I will describe, is BB84. It was the first QKD protocol ever proposed. Let’s explore how it works.

## The BB84 Protocol
Consider the computational basis states ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩, along with the plus/minus basis states ∣+⟩ and ∣-⟩. Let us call the two parties exchanging information Alice and Bob. Let us call an eavesdropper hoping to intercept information Eve. The BB84 protocol functions as follows:
- State Preparation: Alice randomly prepares qubits in either the computational basis {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩} or the plus/minus basis {∣+⟩, ∣−⟩}.
- Transmission: Alice sends these qubits to Bob via a quantum channel.
- Measurement: Bob measures each received qubit in either the computational basis or the plus/minus basis. He chooses at random which basis he will use.
- Basis Check: Once all qubits have been sent, Alice and Bob make public the bases in which they sent and received qubits. Because the qubits have already been sent and measured, this information is useless to Eve.
- Eavesdropper Check: If Eve interfered with transmission, it is highly likely that she will be detected. Consider the two equally likely scenarios:
  - Eve measures in the wrong basis: in this scenario, Eve collapses the quantum state, leading to potential discrepancies when Alice and Bob compare bases.
  - Eve measures in the correct basis: in this scenario, the quantum state is preserved and there is no discrepancy when Alice and Bob compare bases.

After transmission is complete, Alice and Bob take a subset of the qubits they transmitted/received and compare them publicly. If discrepancy in their measurements exceeds 25%, they discard the transmission and begin again. Using this procedure, the probability that Eve manages to go undetected is ¾m, where m is the number of publicly compared bits. For each additional bit that Alice and Bob compare publicly, the probability that Eve goes undetected decreases by a factor of ¾. This exponential decay makes detection of Eve highly probable for sufficiently large m. The perfect security of this protocol is possible because of the no cloning principle and quantum measurement disturbance. Eve can’t copy the qubit being sent and measure her copy, and her measurement fundamentally alters the information being sent.

## Shortfalls of BB84
While BB84 and other QKD protocols have promise, there are significant limitations to their efficiency in practice. For starters, QKD protocols do not provide a method for authenticating the party transmitting messages. In other words, how is Bob to know that the information he is receiving is being sent by Alice? If Bob is able to establish a secure connection with an adversary believing it to be Alice, this could lead to the divulgence of sensitive information. Additionally, QKD requires an established quantum information channel such as a fiber optic line. This makes it impossible to implement on a traditional network. Quantum networks are very difficult and costly to maintain; they are error-prone, and any error in the transmission of information significantly reduces the effectiveness of any QKD protocol. Finally, in my opinion the largest threat to QKD is the risk of denial of service attacks. If some adversary were to simply intercept and measure every qubit being sent over the quantum communication channel, the protocol would be useless. This would be fairly easy to do, and detrimental to the function of any QKD protocol.

Regardless of any drawbacks, the perfect security of QKD protocols in the cryptographic sense of the word (exact correctness and security) makes it an exciting family of protocols to explore. It has significant potential in a future of exponential speedup in information processing.
